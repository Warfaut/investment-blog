# Revolut — Growth, Monetisation & Cash Flow Quality Analysis

This repository contains a fundamental, data-driven analysis of **Revolut**, focused on understanding the **quality of growth**, **monetisation dynamics**, **operating leverage**, and **cash flow sustainability**.

The analysis is based exclusively on publicly disclosed IFRS annual reports for the period **2020–2024**.

---

## 🔍 Objective

The core objective of this analysis is to answer the following question:

> **Is Revolut’s rapid growth translating into higher-quality revenues and sustainable cash generation?**

Rather than focusing solely on headline growth metrics, the model explores *how* growth is achieved and *whether it is economically durable*.

---

## 📊 Scope of Analysis

The Excel model is structured into the following analytical blocks:

- Growth & user expansion  
- ARPU and monetisation trends  
- Incremental (new user) economics  
- Cost structure and operating leverage  
- Core operating cash flow quality  
- Valuation (multiples and implied growth)

---

## 📈 1. Growth Overview

Between 2020 and 2024, Revolut scaled rapidly:

- **Revenue CAGR (2020–2024): ~93%**
- **User CAGR (2020–2024): ~33%**

**Key insight:**  
Revenue growth consistently outpaced user growth, indicating improving monetisation rather than pure volume-driven expansion.

---

## 💰 2. ARPU Expansion

Average Revenue per User (ARPU) increased materially over the period:

- ARPU grew from **~£15 (2020)** to **~£69 (2024)**

This reflects:
- deeper product penetration  
- increasing contribution from subscriptions, trading and FX  
- higher engagement of mature users  

---

## 🚀 3. Incremental ARPU — Quality of New Users

To assess whether new users are becoming more valuable, the analysis calculates **Incremental ARPU**:
Incremental ARPU = ΔRevenue / ΔUsers
To avoid distortions:
- 2020 is excluded as the base year  
- 2021 is treated as a COVID / FX-driven outlier  
- The analysis focuses on **2022–2024**

### Key findings:
- From 2023 onwards, **Incremental ARPU consistently exceeds Average ARPU**
- In 2024, incremental ARPU reached **~£185 vs ~£69 average ARPU**

**Interpretation:**  
Newly acquired users monetise significantly better than the existing base, indicating improving customer quality and scalable monetisation.

---

## 🧾 4. Cost Structure & Operating Leverage

Since 2022, operating expenses have grown materially slower than revenue:

- Opex / Revenue declined  
- Operating margins expanded sharply in 2023–2024  

This confirms the presence of **strong operating leverage** as the platform scales.

---

## 💧 5. Cash Flow Quality (Advanced Analysis)

Reported operating cash flow is heavily distorted by movements in customer balances.

To assess true cash generation, the analysis focuses on:

> **Core Operating Cash Flow**  
> (Operating cash flow before movements in customer balances and hedging arrangements)

### Key results:
- Core operating cash flow turned strongly positive from 2023  
- Core CF / Operating Profit stabilised at **~1.35–1.38×** in 2023–2024  

**Interpretation:**  
Revolut’s profitability is now fully cash-backed, with high-quality earnings rather than balance-sheet-driven cash inflows.

---

## 💼 6. Valuation Perspective

Given Revolut’s private status, valuation is approached conservatively using:

- Revenue multiples  
- Implied growth (reverse-style logic)  
- ARPU × Users sanity checks  

At an implied enterprise value of ~£25bn:
- The market prices **mid-20s revenue CAGR** over the next five years  
- This appears achievable given:
  - accelerating incremental ARPU  
  - visible operating leverage  
  - improving cash conversion  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Growth is increasingly **quality-driven**, not volume-driven  
- New users monetise better than legacy users  
- Operating leverage is clearly visible post-2022  
- Core cash generation supports reported profitability  
- Valuation is driven primarily by ARPU expansion rather than user growth alone
