# WACC Assumptions – Adyen (Base Case)

The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is estimated using the CAPM
framework. Given Adyen’s minimal leverage, WACC is driven primarily by
the cost of equity.

| Component | Assumption |
|---------|------------|
| Risk-free rate | 2.5% |
| Beta | 1.2 |
| Equity risk premium | 5.5% |
| Cost of equity (Ke) | 9.1% |
| After-tax cost of debt | 2.0% |
| Equity weight | 95% |
| Debt weight | 5% |
| **WACC** | **~8.8%** |
