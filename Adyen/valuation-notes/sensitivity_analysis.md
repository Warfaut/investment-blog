# Sensitivity Analysis — Terminal Value (Gordon Growth)

The table below illustrates the sensitivity of Adyen’s terminal value to changes
in the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and terminal growth rate (g).

Base assumptions:
- Terminal year FCF (2028E): €1,105m
- Base WACC: 8.8%
- Base terminal growth (g): 2.5%

## Terminal Value Sensitivity (€m)

| WACC \ g | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% |
|--------|------|------|------|
| 8.0% | 18,780 | 20,450 | 22,530 |
| 8.8% | **16,370** | **18,000** | **19,950** |
| 9.5% | 14,760 | 16,040 | 17,580 |

The sensitivity analysis highlights the strong impact of long-term assumptions
on valuation outcomes, reinforcing the importance of using conservative base-case
inputs in the DCF model.
