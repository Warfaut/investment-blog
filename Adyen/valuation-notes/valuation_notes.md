# 📈 Valuation Notes – Adyen N.V.

This document prepares the analytical foundation for valuing Adyen using
**relative valuation (multiples)** and **intrinsic valuation (DCF)**.
The purpose of this section is to define:

- the correct peer group,
- the valuation methodologies to be used,
- the metrics required for later numerical analysis,
- and the structure of the final valuation tables.

No calculations are performed at this stage.

# 1. Valuation Methodologies

Adyen will be valued using three standard approaches:

## **1) Relative Valuation (Multiples)**  
Based on comparable companies in the payments & fintech industry.

Key metrics to be used:
- **EV / Sales**
- **EV / EBITDA**
- **EV / EBIT**
- **P / E**
- **Price / Free Cash Flow**

---

## **2) Intrinsic Valuation (DCF)**  
Discounting future free cash flows using:

- WACC  
- Revenue growth assumptions  
- Margin expansion expectations  
- Terminal value (Gordon Growth or Exit Multiple)

---

## **3) Cross-Check (Rule of 40 & FCF Yield)**  
Useful for high-growth payment processors.

---

# 2. Peer Group Selection (Comparable Companies)

Choosing the correct peers is critical.  
Adyen competes in high-growth, modern full-stack payments, not legacy acquiring.

## **Tier 1 Direct Competitors (Core Peers)**  
| Company | Ticker | Region | Rationale |
|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Stripe** | Private | US | Closest business model; full-stack; enterprise expansion |
| **Checkout.com** | Private | UK | High-growth PSP, similar merchant base |
| **Block (Square)** | SQ | US | Strong SMB + payments ecosystem; some overlap |
| **PayPal** | PYPL | US | Global digital payments, large merchant base |
| **Global Payments** | GPN | US | Large processor; enterprise clients |
| **Fiserv / Clover** | FI | US | POS + payments infrastructure |

---

## **Tier 2 Secondary Peers (for cross-check only)**  
| Company | Ticker | Region | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Worldline** | WLN | EU | Legacy infrastructure; slower growth |
| **Nexi** | NEXI | EU | Similar scale but lower margins |
| **Lightspeed** | LSPD | CA | SMB-oriented; POS ecosystem |
| **Shift4** | FOUR | US | High-growth processor; strong POS footprint |

---

# 3. Metrics Required for Final Valuation

To compute final multiples, we will later need:

## **Company Metrics (Adyen-specific)**  
- Market Cap  
- Enterprise Value (EV)  
- Net Revenue  
- EBITDA  
- EBIT  
- Net Income  
- Free Cash Flow  
- Net Cash Position  
- Shares Outstanding  

_(values will be pulled from market data; not included yet)_

---

## **Peer Metrics**
For each peer we will later compute:

- EV / Sales (LTM & NTM)
- EV / EBITDA (LTM & NTM)
- P / E (LTM & NTM)
- Revenue Growth Rate
- EBITDA Margin
- FCF Yield

## **Implied Valuation Range (to be filled later)**

| Multiple | Low Case | Base Case | High Case |
|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| EV/Sales | — | — | — |
| EV/EBITDA | — | — | — |
| P/E | — | — | — |
| DCF | — | — | — |

# 5. Notes for Future Calculations

Once we move to the numerical phase, we will:

### **• Gather real-time market data**  
(share price, EV, market cap)

### **• Build a forward-looking model**  
(revenue growth based on H1 2025 trends)

### **• Estimate WACC**  
(using CAPM: beta, risk-free rate, market premium)

### **• Perform DCF valuation**  
(including margin expansion to 2026 as guided)

### **• Compare with peers**  
(Stripe, PayPal, Block, Worldline etc.)

# 6. Summary

This document defines the structure and methodology for valuing Adyen.
Calculations will be performed once all qualitative sections are completed.
