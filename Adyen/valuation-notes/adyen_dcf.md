€# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation — Adyen N.V.

## Executive Summary

This analysis presents a fundamental valuation of Adyen N.V. based on a full Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, incorporating explicit operating forecasts, free cash flow projections, terminal value estimation, and sensitivity analysis.

Under the base-case scenario, the DCF implies an enterprise value of approximately **€17.1bn** and an equity value of approximately **€23.6bn**, corresponding to a fair value of roughly **€750 per share**. This compares to a current market price of approximately **€1,526 per share**, implying limited upside under conservative assumptions.

Key valuation inputs include a **WACC of 8.8%**, a **terminal growth rate of 2.5%**, and a gradual normalization of growth and margins over the explicit forecast period (2025–2028). Sensitivity analysis highlights that valuation outcomes are highly dependent on long-term assumptions, particularly the cost of capital and terminal growth rate.

A reverse DCF framework suggests that the current market valuation implies either materially higher long-term growth or a structurally lower cost of capital than assumed in the base case.

Overall, while Adyen remains a high-quality global payments platform with strong structural tailwinds, the current valuation appears demanding under a disciplined fundamental framework.

## 1. DCF Methodology Overview

The DCF approach estimates intrinsic value by discounting future free cash flows generated by the business back to present value using an appropriate cost of capital.

The enterprise value is calculated as:

**Enterprise Value = Σ (FCFₜ / (1 + WACC)ᵗ) + Terminal Value**

This methodology is particularly suitable for Adyen due to:
- strong and visible revenue growth,
- high operating leverage,
- strong free cash flow conversion,
- limited balance sheet leverage.

## 2. Forecast Period and Revenue Assumptions

The explicit forecast period covers **2025–2028**, following the latest full-year reported financials.

### Historical Revenue Context (€m)

| Year | Revenue | YoY |
|-----|--------|-----|
| 2020 | 684 | — |
| 2021 | 1,002 | 46% |
| 2022 | 1,330 | 33% |
| 2023 | 1,626 | 22% |
| 2024 | 1,996 | 23% |

Revenue growth has decelerated as the business has scaled, consistent with a transition from hypergrowth to a more mature growth profile.

### Base Case Revenue Forecast (€m)

| Year | Revenue | YoY |
|-----|--------|-----|
| 2025E | 2,187 | 10% |
| 2026E | 2,521 | 15% |
| 2027E | 2,848 | 13% |
| 2028E | 3,158 | 11% |

Growth assumptions reflect:
- continued market share gains,
- normalization versus post-pandemic growth,
- gradual convergence toward long-term industry growth rates.

---

## 3. Operating Profitability and Free Cash Flow

Operating assumptions are derived from historical margins, management guidance, and normalization toward long-term sustainable levels.

### Key Operating Assumptions
- EBITDA margin stabilizing around mid-50% over the forecast period.
- Depreciation and amortization averaging ~4–5% of revenue.
- Capital expenditures averaging ~4–5% of revenue.
- Cash tax rate aligned with historical effective tax rates.
- No material working capital build assumed, consistent with Adyen’s business model.

### Free Cash Flow Forecast (€m)

| Year | EBITDA | EBIT | Cash Taxes | CapEx | FCF |
|-----|-------|------|-----------|------|-----|
| 2025E | 1,214 | 1,117 | (279) | (111) | 824 |
| 2026E | 1,400 | 1,288 | (322) | (128) | 949 |
| 2027E | 1,581 | 1,455 | (364) | (145) | 1,073 |
| 2028E | 1,753 | 1,613 | (403) | (161) | 1,189 |

Free cash flow conversion remains strong at approximately **65–70% of EBITDA**, consistent with historical performance.

---

## 4. Discount Rate (WACC) Assumptions

The base-case weighted average cost of capital is estimated at **8.8%**, reflecting:

- risk-free rate aligned with long-term European sovereign yields,
- equity risk premium consistent with developed markets,
- business risk premium reflecting Adyen’s scale, profitability, and competitive position,
- minimal financial leverage.

The WACC is treated as a key valuation driver and tested extensively in sensitivity analysis.

---

## 5. Terminal Value

Terminal value is estimated using the **Gordon Growth method**, assuming a conservative perpetual growth rate aligned with long-term nominal GDP growth.

### Terminal Value Inputs
- Terminal growth rate (g): **2.5%**
- Terminal year FCF (2028E): **€1,189m**
- WACC: **8.8%**

**Terminal Value = FCF₍₂₀₂₈₎ × (1 + g) / (WACC − g)**

This results in:
- Terminal Value: **~€19.4bn**
- Present Value of Terminal Value: **~€13.8bn**

---

## 6. Enterprise Value and Equity Value

### Enterprise Value Breakdown (€m)

- PV of explicit FCF: **~€3.2bn**
- PV of terminal value: **~€13.8bn**
- **Enterprise Value:** **~€17.1bn**

### Equity Value Bridge (€m)

- Enterprise Value: **17,050**
- Net cash & investments: **~6,500**
- **Equity Value:** **~23,550**

With approximately **31.4m shares outstanding**, this implies:

**Fair value per share ≈ €750**

## 7. Sensitivity Analysis (EV)

Sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact of changes in WACC and terminal growth assumptions on enterprise value.

### Sensitivity Table — Enterprise Value (€bn)

| WACC \ g | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% |
|--------|------|------|------|
| 8.0% | 19.9 | 21.8 | 24.4 |
| 8.5% | 17.8 | 19.3 | 21.3 |
| 8.8% | 16.1 | 17.1 | 18.6 |
| 9.0% | 15.4 | 16.3 | 17.6 |
| 9.5% | 13.8 | 14.5 | 15.5 |

---

## 8. Equity Value Sensitivity

Adding net cash to the enterprise value yields the following equity value sensitivity.

### Equity Value Sensitivity (€m)

| WACC \ g | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% |
|--------|------|------|------|
| 8.0% | 24,170 | 25,559 | 27,226 |
| 8.5% | 23,060 | 24,241 | 25,636 |
| 8.8% | 22,473 | 23,550 | 24,814 |
| 9.0% | 22,109 | 23,125 | 24,312 |
| 9.5% | 21,284 | 22,169 | 23,191 |

## 9. Market vs Base Case

At a current market price of approximately **€1,526 per share**, Adyen trades significantly above the base-case intrinsic value range derived from the DCF.

This implies that the market is pricing in:
- higher long-term growth,
- structurally lower cost of capital,
- or sustained premium valuation due to exceptional business quality.

---

## 10. Reverse DCF Interpretation

A reverse DCF analysis suggests that the current market valuation implies either:
- a terminal growth rate of approximately **4.5–5.0%**, or
- a long-term WACC closer to **6.5–7.0%**,  
or a combination of both.

These assumptions require a high degree of confidence in Adyen’s long-term growth durability and risk profile relative to global peers.

---
# 🧠 Investment Conclusion — Adyen N.V.

This analysis combines a full discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, peer multiple benchmarking, and a reverse DCF framework to assess Adyen’s intrinsic value relative to its current market price.

---

## Base-Case Valuation Summary

Under a conservative base-case DCF scenario, Adyen’s intrinsic valuation implies:

- **Enterprise Value:** ~€17.1bn  
- **Equity Value:** ~€23.6bn  
- **Implied Fair Value per Share:** ~€750  

Key base-case assumptions include:

- WACC of **8.8%**  
- Terminal growth rate of **2.5%**  
- Gradual normalization of revenue growth and margins over the explicit forecast period  
- High but stable free cash flow conversion  

Under these assumptions, Adyen appears **fully valued to moderately overvalued** relative to intrinsic value.

---

## Market vs Intrinsic Value Disconnect

Adyen currently trades at approximately **€1,500+ per share**, implying an enterprise value of roughly **€36–37bn**.

The gap between market value and base-case intrinsic value is driven almost entirely by **terminal value assumptions**, rather than near-term cash flow forecasts.

More than **85–90% of enterprise value** is derived from terminal value under both the base-case and market-implied scenarios.

---

## Reverse DCF Insights

A reverse DCF analysis indicates that the current market valuation implies:

- A **materially higher terminal growth rate (~4–5%+)**,  
  **or**
- A structurally lower long-term cost of capital,  
  **or**
- A combination of both.

These implied assumptions significantly exceed:

- Long-term nominal GDP growth  
- Conservative sector growth expectations  
- The base-case DCF assumptions used in this analysis  

This suggests that the market prices Adyen as a **structurally exceptional long-duration compounder**, rather than a mature payments infrastructure provider.

---

## Peer Valuation Cross-Check

Peer multiple analysis supports the view that Adyen is treated as a premium asset:

- Adyen trades at **4–9x EV/Sales** and **2–3x EV/EBITDA** relative to large-cap payment peers.
- This premium reflects:
  - Superior EBITDA margins (~45%)  
  - Strong free cash flow conversion  
  - Net cash balance sheet  
  - Scalable, infrastructure-first business model  

However, peers with lower growth and margin profiles trade at significantly discounted multiples, reinforcing that Adyen’s valuation embeds **long-term execution perfection**.

---

## Investment View

Adyen represents a **best-in-class global payments infrastructure platform** with strong competitive positioning, high margins, and durable secular tailwinds.

However:

- The current valuation embeds **optimistic long-term assumptions**.
- Upside is primarily driven by **terminal value expansion**, not near-term fundamentals.
- Downside risk is asymmetric if growth, margins, or discount rates disappoint.

---

## Final Assessment

**Investment Stance: Neutral / Quality Hold**

- Attractive for investors with **high conviction in long-term structural growth** and tolerance for valuation risk.
- Less compelling for valuation-driven investors seeking margin of safety under conservative assumptions.

At current levels, valuation — not business quality — is the primary investment risk.

---

*This analysis highlights the importance of long-term assumptions in valuing high-quality compounders and demonstrates how small changes in terminal growth and discount rates can materially alter intrinsic value.*structurally superior growth and long-term competitive advantages. For disciplined fundamental investors, a more attractive entry point would likely require either a material price correction or clear evidence of sustainably higher long-term growth than assumed in the base case.
