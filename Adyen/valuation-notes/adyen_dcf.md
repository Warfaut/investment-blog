# 📉 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation – Adyen N.V.
# Adyen — DCF Valuation  
## Executive Summary

- This analysis presents a fundamental valuation of Adyen N.V. based on a full Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, incorporating conservative operating assumptions and a disciplined view on long-term growth and cost of capital.

- Under the base case scenario, the DCF implies an **Enterprise Value of approximately €17.1bn** and an **Equity Value of c. €23.6bn**, corresponding to a **fair value of ~€750 per share**.

- Key valuation assumptions include a **WACC of 8.8%**, a **terminal growth rate of 2.5%**, and a gradual normalization of growth and margins over the forecast period (2025–2028).

- A comprehensive sensitivity analysis (WACC × terminal growth) indicates that valuation outcomes are highly sensitive to terminal assumptions, with reasonable scenarios implying equity values materially below the current market price.

- At the current market price of approximately **€1,526 per share**, Adyen trades at a significant premium to the base-case DCF valuation. A reverse DCF analysis suggests that the market is implicitly pricing in either a **structurally lower cost of capital (c. 6.5–7.0%)**, a **substantially higher long-term growth rate (c. 5–6%)**, or a combination of both.

- While Adyen remains a best-in-class global payments platform with strong competitive positioning and long-term structural tailwinds, the current valuation leaves **limited margin of safety** under conservative fundamental assumptions.

- Overall, the analysis highlights a clear divergence between intrinsic value under a disciplined DCF framework and the expectations embedded in the current market price, making valuation risk the primary consideration for investors at current levels.

# 1. Overview of DCF Methodology

The DCF approach estimates intrinsic value by discounting future free cash flows (FCF) generated by the business:

**Enterprise Value = Σ (FCF_t / (1 + WACC)^t ) + Terminal Value**

Adyen is suited for DCF valuation due to:
- consistent revenue growth,
- predictable margin expansion (management target: EBITDA >50% by 2026),
- strong free cash flow conversion.

---

# 2. Key Components of the DCF

The DCF model for Adyen will consist of:

### 1️⃣ **Forecast Period (2025–2029)**  
Based on:
- revenue growth by segment,  
- margin expansion assumptions,  
- capex guidelines (≤5% of net revenue),  
- working capital patterns.

### 2️⃣ **WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)**  
WACC will be computed using:
- risk-free rate  
- beta  
- market risk premium  
- cost of debt (Adyen has low leverage)  
- capital structure weights  

### 3️⃣ **Terminal Value (TV)**  
Two methods will be used for cross-check:
- **Gordon Growth Model (Perpetuity)**  
- **Exit Multiple Method (EV/EBITDA)**

# 3. Free Cash Flow (FCF) Calculation

FCF is calculated using:

\[
FCF_t = EBIT_t \times (1 - Tax\ Rate) + D\&A_t - CapEx_t - \Delta WC_t
\]

### Template FCF Table

| Year | EBIT | Tax Rate | NOPAT | D&A | CapEx | ΔWC | FCF |
|------|------|----------|--------|------|--------|------|------|
| 2024A | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 2025E | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 2026E | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 2027E | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| 2028E | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

# 4. WACC Calculation Framework

### **Cost of Equity (Ke)**  
\[
Ke = R_f + \beta \times (ERP)
\]

**Inputs needed later:**
- Risk-free rate (10Y government bonds)
- Beta (industry levered beta)
- Equity risk premium (ERP)

---

### **Cost of Debt (Kd)**  
\[
Kd = Interest\ Rate \times (1 - Tax\ Rate)
\]

Adyen has no traditional long-term debt, so Kd will be minimal.

---

### **Capital Structure Weights**
\[
WACC = Ke \times w_e + Kd \times w_d
\]

Since Adyen is equity-heavy, we expect:  
**w_e > 95%**, **w_d < 5%**

---

# 5. Terminal Value (TV)

### **Method 1 — Perpetuity Growth (Gordon Model)**  
\[
TV = \frac{FCF_{last} \times (1 + g)}{WACC - g}
\]

Where:
- *g* = long-term growth rate (typical range: 2%–4%)

---

### **Method 2 — Exit Multiple Method**
\[
TV = EBITDA_{last} \times Exit\ Multiple
\]

Common multiples for payments sector:  
- **EV/EBITDA: 18–28x** (high quality processors like Adyen and Stripe)

---

# 6. Present Value (PV) of Cash Flows

\[
PV(FCF_t) = \frac{FCF_t}{(1 + WACC)^t}
\]

\[
PV(TV) = \frac{TV}{(1 + WACC)^N}
\]

---

# 7. Enterprise Value (EV)

\[
EV = \sum PV(FCF_t) + PV(TV)
\]

---

# 8. Equity Value

\[
Equity\ Value = EV + Cash - Debt
\]

Adyen typically has:
- **Large net cash position**
- **No long-term borrowings**

Meaning:
\[
Equity\ Value ≈ EV + Cash
\]

---

# 9. Intrinsic Value Per Share

\[
Value\ Per\ Share = \frac{Equity\ Value}{Shares\ Outstanding}
\]

---

# 10. Sensitivity Tables (to be added later)

We will build sensitivity matrices for:

### 📌 WACC vs Terminal Growth (g)
### 📌 WACC vs Exit Multiple
### 📌 Revenue growth vs EBITDA margin

Example structure:

| WACC \ g | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% | 3.5% |
|----------|------|------|------|------|
| 7.0% | — | — | — | — |
| 7.5% | — | — | — | — |
| 8.0% | — | — | — | — |
