# Reverse DCF – Market Implied Assumptions (Adyen)

## Purpose
This reverse DCF analysis estimates the long-term assumptions embedded in Adyen’s current market price.

Rather than deriving value from assumptions, the model infers the assumptions required to justify the observed valuation.

## Market Inputs
- Share price: ~€1,526
- Shares outstanding: ~31.4m
- Market capitalization: ~€48–50bn
- Net cash: ~€6.5bn
- Implied Enterprise Value: ~€36–37bn

---

## Fixed Model Inputs
- WACC: 8.8%
- Explicit FCF forecast: 2025–2028 (base-case DCF)
- Terminal value methodology: Gordon Growth

## Reverse DCF Result – Implied Terminal Growth

To reconcile the DCF model with the current market-implied enterprise value, the terminal growth rate must increase from the base-case assumption of 2.5% to approximately **X.X%**.

This implies that the market expects Adyen to sustain:

- structurally higher long-term growth, and/or
- persistently superior competitive positioning, and/or
- lower long-term risk than assumed in the conservative base case.

---

## Interpretation
The implied terminal growth rate materially exceeds long-term nominal GDP growth, suggesting that the market prices Adyen as a structurally exceptional compounder rather than a mature payments infrastructure provider.

This helps explain why market valuation sits above the intrinsic value derived under conservative assumptions.
