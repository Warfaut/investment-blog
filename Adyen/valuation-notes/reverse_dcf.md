# Reverse DCF – Market Implied Assumptions (Adyen)

## Purpose
This reverse DCF analysis estimates the long-term assumptions embedded in Adyen’s current market price.

Rather than deriving value from assumptions, the model infers the assumptions required to justify the observed valuation.

## Reverse DCF — Market Implied Terminal Growth

Using the current market-implied enterprise value of approximately €36.6bn and holding all base-case DCF assumptions constant (including WACC of 8.8% and explicit FCF forecasts for 2025–2028), the model implies a terminal growth rate of approximately **6.1%**.

This implied growth rate materially exceeds long-term nominal GDP growth and the conservative base-case assumption of 2.5%, indicating that the market prices Adyen as a structurally exceptional long-duration compounder.

Under such assumptions, more than 90% of enterprise value is driven by terminal value, highlighting the sensitivity of current valuation to long-term growth expectations and discount rates.

## Interpretation
The implied terminal growth rate materially exceeds long-term nominal GDP growth, suggesting that the market prices Adyen as a structurally exceptional compounder rather than a mature payments infrastructure provider.

This helps explain why market valuation sits above the intrinsic value derived under conservative assumptions.
