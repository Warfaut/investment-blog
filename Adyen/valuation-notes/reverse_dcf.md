# Reverse DCF – Market Implied Assumptions (Adyen)

## Purpose
This reverse DCF analysis estimates the long-term assumptions embedded in Adyen’s current market price.

Rather than deriving value from assumptions, the model infers the assumptions required to justify the observed valuation.

## Reverse DCF — Market Implied Terminal Growth

Using the current market-implied enterprise value of approximately €36.6bn and holding all base-case DCF assumptions constant (including WACC of 8.8% and explicit FCF forecasts for 2025–2028), the model implies a terminal growth rate of approximately **6.1%**.

This implied growth rate materially exceeds long-term nominal GDP growth and the conservative base-case assumption of 2.5%, indicating that the market prices Adyen as a structurally exceptional long-duration compounder.

Under such assumptions, more than 90% of enterprise value is driven by terminal value, highlighting the sensitivity of current valuation to long-term growth expectations and discount rates.

## Interpretation

The implied terminal growth rate of approximately 6.1% materially exceeds long-term nominal GDP growth and the conservative base-case assumption of 2.5%.

This indicates that the current market valuation reflects expectations of:
- structurally superior long-term growth,
- sustained high free cash flow conversion,
- and a lower perceived long-term business risk than assumed in the base-case DCF.

As a result, the divergence between the intrinsic value derived under conservative assumptions and the current market price is primarily driven by differences in long-term growth expectations rather than near-term cash flow forecasts.
