# 📋 Peer Multiples – Comparative Valuation Framework (Draft)

This document defines the structure for the peer comparison analysis used in valuing Adyen.
No numerical values are included yet. Multiples will be inserted after we gather market data.

# 1. Purpose of Peer Analysis

Peer valuation helps benchmark Adyen against companies operating in:

- global payments processing  
- PSP infrastructure  
- unified commerce  
- embedded finance  
- high-growth fintech  

The goal is to estimate Adyen’s **fair value range** using:

- EV/Sales  
- EV/EBITDA  
- EV/EBIT  
- P/E  
- FCF Yield

# 2. Peer Group Definition

Peers are split into **Tier 1** (closest competitors) and **Tier 2** (secondary references).

---

## 🔹 Tier 1 – Core Peers (Most Relevant)

| Company | Ticker | Region | Rationale |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Stripe** | Private | US | Most similar infrastructure-first payment platform |
| **Checkout.com** | Private | UK | High-growth PSP, enterprise online focus |
| **PayPal** | PYPL | US | Global merchant + consumer payments ecosystem |
| **Block (Square)** | SQ | US | POS + ubiquity in SMB, integrated ecosystem |
| **Global Payments** | GPN | US | Large enterprise processor |
| **Fiserv / Clover** | FI | US | Strong POS footprint and merchant acquiring |

## 🔹 Tier 2 – Secondary Peers (Supportive Cross-Check)

| Company | Ticker | Region | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Worldline** | WLN | EU | Legacy PSP, slower growth |
| **Nexi** | NEXI | EU | Large acquirer with weaker margins |
| **Lightspeed** | LSPD | CA | SMB POS ecosystem |
| **Shift4** | FOUR | US | High-growth merchant processor |

# 3. Multiples to Be Collected (Template)

We will gather both **LTM (Last Twelve Months)** and **NTM (Next Twelve Months)** multiples:

### 💰 Valuation Multiples

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **EV/Sales** | Best for comparing high-growth fintechs |
| **EV/EBITDA** | Core profitability benchmark |
| **EV/EBIT** | Adjusts for D&A differences |
| **P/E** | Measures earnings-based value |
| **FCF Yield** | Cash generation benchmark |

### Tier 1 Peer Table — Trading Multiples Snapshot (TTM)

| Company | EV/Sales (TTM) | EV/EBITDA (TTM) | P/E (TTM) | P/E (NTM) | Revenue Growth | EBITDA Margin |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adyen** | ~12.8x | ~21.4x | ~42.6x | ~30.5x | ~19% | ~45% |
| PayPal | ~1.7x | ~7.5x | ~12.0x | ~10.3x | ~7% | ~20% |
| Block (Square) | ~1.4x | ~12.8x | ~13.1x | ~19.6x | ~2–3% | ~7% |
| Global Payments | ~3.2x | ~7.6x | ~12.3x | ~6.0x | ~0–1% | ~32% |
| Fiserv (Clover) | ~3.1x | ~7.3x | ~10.5x | ~8.0x | low single-digit | ~30% |

Adyen trades at a material premium to global payment peers, reflecting superior margins, balance sheet strength, and perceived long-term growth durability.

# 5. Implied Valuation Range (Template)

Adyen’s implied valuation will be derived by applying peer multiples to its:

- Net Revenue  
- EBITDA  
- EBIT  
- Net Income  

### Template Table

| Multiple Type | Low | Base | High |
|----------------|-----|------|-------|
| EV/Sales | — | — | — |
| EV/EBITDA | — | — | — |
| P/E | — | — | — |
| FCF Yield | — | — | — |

# 6. Notes for Future Calculation

When we move to the numerical analysis phase, we will:

### 1️⃣ Pull real market data for each peer  
- Market caps  
- EV (including net debt)  
- Analyst consensus forecasts  

### 2️⃣ Normalize multiples  
- Remove outliers  
- Adjust for different fiscal years  
- Compare growth-adjusted multiples  

### 3️⃣ Create valuation ranges  
- Low = conservative peers  
- Base = median peer  
- High = premium peers
