# 📋 Peer Multiples – Comparative Valuation Framework (Draft)

This document defines the structure for the peer comparison analysis used in valuing Adyen.
No numerical values are included yet. Multiples will be inserted after we gather market data.

# 1. Purpose of Peer Analysis

Peer valuation helps benchmark Adyen against companies operating in:

- global payments processing  
- PSP infrastructure  
- unified commerce  
- embedded finance  
- high-growth fintech  

The goal is to estimate Adyen’s **fair value range** using:

- EV/Sales  
- EV/EBITDA  
- EV/EBIT  
- P/E  
- FCF Yield

# 2. Peer Group Definition

Peers are split into **Tier 1** (closest competitors) and **Tier 2** (secondary references).

---

## 🔹 Tier 1 – Core Peers (Most Relevant)

| Company | Ticker | Region | Rationale |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Stripe** | Private | US | Most similar infrastructure-first payment platform |
| **Checkout.com** | Private | UK | High-growth PSP, enterprise online focus |
| **PayPal** | PYPL | US | Global merchant + consumer payments ecosystem |
| **Block (Square)** | SQ | US | POS + ubiquity in SMB, integrated ecosystem |
| **Global Payments** | GPN | US | Large enterprise processor |
| **Fiserv / Clover** | FI | US | Strong POS footprint and merchant acquiring |

---

## 🔹 Tier 2 – Secondary Peers (Supportive Cross-Check)

| Company | Ticker | Region | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Worldline** | WLN | EU | Legacy PSP, slower growth |
| **Nexi** | NEXI | EU | Large acquirer with weaker margins |
| **Lightspeed** | LSPD | CA | SMB POS ecosystem |
| **Shift4** | FOUR | US | High-growth merchant processor |

# 3. Multiples to Be Collected (Template)

We will gather both **LTM (Last Twelve Months)** and **NTM (Next Twelve Months)** multiples:

### 💰 Valuation Multiples

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **EV/Sales** | Best for comparing high-growth fintechs |
| **EV/EBITDA** | Core profitability benchmark |
| **EV/EBIT** | Adjusts for D&A differences |
| **P/E** | Measures earnings-based value |
| **FCF Yield** | Cash generation benchmark |

### Tier 1 Peer Table — Trading Multiples Snapshot (TTM)

| Company | EV/Sales (TTM) | EV/EBITDA (TTM) | P/E (TTM) | P/E (NTM) | Revenue Growth | EBITDA Margin |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Adyen** | ~12.8x | ~21.4x | ~42.6x | ~30.5x | ~19% | ~45% |
| PayPal | ~1.7x | ~7.5x | ~12.0x | ~10.3x | ~7% | ~20% |
| Block (Square) | ~1.4x | ~12.8x | ~13.1x | ~19.6x | ~2–3% | ~7% |
| Global Payments | ~3.2x | ~7.6x | ~12.3x | ~6.0x | ~0–1% | ~32% |
| Fiserv (Clover) | ~3.1x | ~7.3x | ~10.5x | ~8.0x | low single-digit | ~30% |

Adyen trades at a material premium to global payment peers, reflecting superior margins, balance sheet strength, and perceived long-term growth durability.

## 5. Implied Valuation Range (Directional)

Based on a comparative review of public peers (PayPal, Block, Global Payments, Fiserv), Adyen trades at a clear premium across most valuation metrics, reflecting its superior margins, growth profile, and balance sheet strength.

The table below presents a **directional implied valuation range** derived from observed peer multiples.


### Template Table

| Multiple Type | Low | Base | High |
|---------------|-----|------|------|
| EV/Sales | Mature processors (GPN, FISV) | Adyen at current multiple | Premium SaaS-like PSP |
| EV/EBITDA | PayPal / GPN range | Adyen current | Long-duration compounder |
| P/E | Traditional payments | Adyen current | Structural growth premium |
| FCF Yield | Cash generative peers | Adyen current | Best-in-class durability |

Across EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA multiples, Adyen trades meaningfully above mature payment processors such as Global Payments and Fiserv, and at a premium to PayPal, reflecting its structurally higher margins, superior free cash flow conversion, and stronger balance sheet.

Relative to Block, Adyen commands a premium due to its enterprise focus, global scalability, and lower earnings volatility.

Overall, peer multiples imply that the market is willing to pay a sustained premium for Adyen’s long-term growth durability and platform quality, consistent with the assumptions embedded in the reverse DCF analysis.

This premium valuation is consistent with the reverse DCF results, which indicate that current market prices embed a long-term growth assumption materially above conservative base-case estimates.

# 6. Notes for Future Calculation

When we move to the numerical analysis phase, we will:

### 1️⃣ Pull real market data for each peer  
- Market caps  
- EV (including net debt)  
- Analyst consensus forecasts  

### 2️⃣ Normalize multiples  
- Remove outliers  
- Adjust for different fiscal years  
- Compare growth-adjusted multiples  

### 3️⃣ Create valuation ranges  
- Low = conservative peers  
- Base = median peer  
- High = premium peers
