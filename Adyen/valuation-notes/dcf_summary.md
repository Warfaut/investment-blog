# DCF Valuation Summary — Adyen N.V.

## Overview

This document summarises the results of a full Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation of Adyen N.V., based on explicitly forecast free cash flows for the period 2025–2028 and a Gordon Growth terminal value.

The objective of this summary is to present the key valuation conclusions, core assumptions, and sensitivity outcomes, without duplicating the detailed Excel model or the full DCF framework documented elsewhere in the repository.

## Key Valuation Assumptions

The base-case DCF model is built on the following high-level assumptions:

- **Base year:** 2024 (last full historical year)
- **Forecast period:** 2025–2028
- **WACC:** 8.8%
- **Terminal growth rate (g):** 2.5%
- **Terminal value method:** Gordon Growth
- **Business profile:** asset-light global payments platform with strong free cash flow conversion

Revenue growth assumptions reflect a gradual normalisation from elevated post-pandemic growth levels toward mature, structurally supported expansion:

- 2025E: 10%  
- 2026E: 15%  
- 2027E: 13%  
- 2028E: 11%

Operating margins and capital intensity are aligned with Adyen’s historical averages and recent normalisation trends.

## DCF Results (Base Case)

All figures below are expressed in **€ millions**, unless stated otherwise.

- **Present value of explicit FCF (2025–2028):** ~€3.24bn  
- **Terminal value (Gordon Growth):** ~€19.4bn  
- **Present value of terminal value:** ~€13.8bn  

### Enterprise Value (EV)
- **Implied Enterprise Value:** **~€17.1bn**

### Equity Value Bridge
- **Net cash & short-term investments:** ~€6.5bn  
- **Equity Value:** **~€23.6bn**

### Per-Share Valuation
- **Shares outstanding:** ~31.4m  
- **Implied value per share:** **~€750**

## Sensitivity Summary (WACC × Terminal Growth)

DCF outcomes are highly sensitive to both the discount rate and terminal growth assumptions.

**Equity Value sensitivity (€ per share):**

| WACC \ g | 2.0% | 2.5% | 3.0% |
|--------|------|------|------|
| 8.0% | ~770 | ~814 | ~867 |
| 8.5% | ~734 | ~772 | ~816 |
| **8.8%** | ~716 | **~750** | ~790 |
| 9.0% | ~704 | ~736 | ~774 |
| 9.5% | ~678 | ~706 | ~739 |

This highlights that relatively small changes in long-term assumptions can materially impact intrinsic value estimates.

## Market vs Intrinsic Value

At the time of analysis, Adyen’s market price implies an equity valuation materially above the base-case DCF outcome.

Under conservative assumptions (WACC 8.8%, g 2.5%), the model suggests that the market is pricing in either:

- a structurally lower long-term cost of capital,  
- sustainably higher terminal growth,  
- or a combination of both.

This places the current valuation toward the upper end of the reasonable intrinsic value range derived from the DCF.

## Market Valuation vs DCF Base Case

At the current market price (~€1,580 per share), Adyen trades at:

- ~21x EV/EBITDA (TTM)
- ~13x EV/Sales
- ~30x forward P/E

Under the base-case DCF assumptions (WACC 8.8%, g 2.5%), intrinsic equity value is estimated at ~€750 per share, implying that the market price embeds:

- structurally lower cost of capital, and/or
- materially higher long-term growth, and/or
- sustained premium profitability beyond the explicit forecast period.

This divergence suggests that valuation risk, rather than operational execution, is the primary driver of expected returns at current levels.

## Investment Takeaway

Under a disciplined base-case DCF framework, **Adyen appears fairly valued to moderately overvalued**.

While the company remains a best-in-class global payments platform with strong competitive positioning, high margins, and excellent free cash flow generation, the current valuation leaves **limited margin of safety** for investors relying purely on fundamental valuation upside.

The investment case therefore hinges less on near-term valuation re-rating and more on long-term conviction in Adyen’s ability to sustain superior growth, defend margins, and justify premium terminal assumptions over an extended horizon.

For valuation-driven investors, entry point and assumption discipline remain critical.
