# Adyen N.V. — DCF Valuation Summary

## Executive Overview

This document summarizes the valuation of Adyen N.V. using a disciplined Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) framework, complemented by sensitivity analysis, a reverse DCF assessment, and a peer multiple cross-check.

Under conservative base-case assumptions, the intrinsic value implied by the DCF model is below Adyen’s current market price. Rather than interpreting this outcome as a shortcoming of the model, the analysis focuses on identifying the long-term assumptions embedded in the market valuation and assessing whether they are justified by Adyen’s business fundamentals.

Overall, the valuation gap reflects differing views on Adyen’s long-term growth durability and competitive longevity rather than near-term earnings or cash flow discrepancies.

## Base-Case DCF Results

The base-case DCF valuation is constructed using the following key inputs:

- Explicit forecast period: 2025–2028  
- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC): 8.8%  
- Terminal growth rate (g): 2.5%  
- Terminal value methodology: Gordon Growth model  

The explicit forecast assumes continued revenue growth with gradual normalization, stable operating leverage, and strong free cash flow conversion consistent with Adyen’s historical performance and management guidance.

Under these assumptions, the model produces an enterprise value below the market-implied valuation. This outcome reflects a conservative long-term view that assumes Adyen gradually converges toward a mature infrastructure-like growth profile rather than sustaining structurally elevated growth indefinitely.

## Sensitivity Analysis

A sensitivity analysis across WACC and terminal growth assumptions demonstrates that Adyen’s valuation is highly sensitive to long-term inputs.

Small changes in terminal growth rates or discount rates result in material swings in enterprise value, with terminal value accounting for the majority of total valuation. This confirms that Adyen should be viewed as a long-duration asset, where valuation outcomes are driven primarily by assumptions about long-term competitive positioning and growth persistence rather than short-term cash flow volatility.

## Reverse DCF — Market-Implied Assumptions

To reconcile the difference between the base-case DCF valuation and the current market price, a reverse DCF analysis was performed.

Holding the base-case explicit cash flow forecasts and WACC constant at 8.8%, the market-implied enterprise value suggests a terminal growth rate materially above the conservative base-case assumption of 2.5%.

The implied long-term growth rate exceeds long-term nominal GDP growth, indicating that the market prices Adyen as a structurally exceptional compounder with durable competitive advantages, rather than as a mature payments infrastructure provider.

This reverse DCF result explains why the market valuation sits above the intrinsic value derived under conservative assumptions: investors are implicitly underwriting sustained above-average growth and profitability far into the future.

## Peer Multiples Cross-Check

A peer multiple analysis provides an additional reality check on the DCF conclusions. Compared against public payment peers such as PayPal, Block, Global Payments, and Fiserv, Adyen trades at a clear premium across key valuation metrics including EV/Sales, EV/EBITDA, and P/E.

This premium reflects several structural advantages:

- best-in-class EBITDA margins,  
- superior free cash flow conversion,  
- a net cash balance sheet,  
- and an enterprise-focused merchant base with lower credit and churn risk.  

Relative to mature processors such as Global Payments and Fiserv, Adyen’s premium is justified by stronger growth and margin profiles. Relative to higher-growth peers such as Block, Adyen benefits from lower earnings volatility and a more infrastructure-oriented revenue mix.

Overall, peer multiples support the conclusion that the market assigns Adyen a sustained quality and growth premium consistent with the assumptions implied by the reverse DCF analysis.

## Valuation Takeaway

The combined evidence from the DCF, sensitivity analysis, reverse DCF, and peer comparison indicates that Adyen is currently priced for long-term growth durability well above conservative fundamental assumptions.

While the base-case DCF suggests limited upside at current levels, the market valuation can be rationalized by expectations of prolonged above-GDP growth, structurally high margins, and long-duration free cash flow compounding.

As a result, Adyen may remain attractive for investors with high conviction in its structural competitive advantages and long-term execution, but offers limited margin of safety for valuation-driven investors without a more favorable entry point or a clear acceleration in long-term fundamentals.
