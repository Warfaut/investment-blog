## Terminal Value — Method Selection and Interpretation

Two approaches were used to estimate Adyen’s terminal value:

### Key Assumptions

- Terminal growth rate (g): 2.5%
- WACC: 8.8%
- Terminal year FCF (2028E): €1,105m

### Terminal Value Calculation

TV = FCF_2028 × (1 + g) / (WACC − g)

TV = 1,105 × 1.025 / (0.088 − 0.025) ≈ €18,000m

## Terminal Value — Exit Multiple Cross-Check

As a market-based cross-check, terminal value is also estimated using
an EV/EBITDA exit multiple.

### Key Assumptions

- Exit multiple: 16× EV / EBITDA
- Terminal year EBITDA (2028E): €1,673m

### Terminal Value Calculation

TV = EBITDA_2028 × Exit Multiple

TV = 1,673 × 16 ≈ €26,800m

The Gordon Growth method is selected as the **primary terminal value** for the
DCF valuation, as it anchors long-term cash flow growth to macroeconomic
fundamentals and ensures consistency with the assumed cost of capital.

The exit multiple approach serves as a **market-based cross-check**, reflecting
current valuation levels for high-quality global payments businesses. The higher
result under this method highlights the potential upside in scenarios where
Adyen sustains premium market positioning and investor sentiment remains strong.

For valuation purposes, the model adopts the Gordon Growth terminal value as a
more conservative and methodologically robust estimate, while the exit multiple
result is treated as an upper-bound reference.
