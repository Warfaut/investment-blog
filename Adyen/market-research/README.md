## Market Definition

Adyen operates at the intersection of:
- global merchant acquiring,
- online and unified commerce,
- enterprise-grade payment infrastructure.

Unlike consumer-facing payment platforms, Adyen focuses on large, international merchants requiring:
- omnichannel acceptance,
- high reliability and uptime,
- deep API-level integration,
- global scalability.

## Market Size & Growth

The global payments market is large but fragmented, with structurally different growth profiles across segments.

While overall payment volumes grow in line with nominal GDP, enterprise digital commerce and cross-border payments continue to outgrow the market average.

Adyen’s addressable market expands not only through volume growth but via:
- increased payment complexity,
- geographic expansion of global merchants,
- higher attach rates of value-added services.

  ## Competitive Positioning

Adyen competes not on price, but on:
- infrastructure depth,
- global coverage,
- reliability and scalability.

Compared to peers:
- PayPal and Block prioritize consumer ecosystems and SMBs,
- Global Payments and Fiserv operate legacy-heavy acquiring stacks,
- Adyen is architected as a single global platform.

This results in:
- higher switching costs,
- lower price sensitivity,
- structurally higher margins.

  ## Unit Economics & Margin Durability

Adyen’s cost base is largely fixed, with incremental payment volumes carrying high contribution margins.

As transaction volumes scale:
- revenue grows faster than operating costs,
- EBITDA margins expand structurally,
- free cash flow conversion remains high.

This operating leverage underpins market expectations of long-term margin durability, even as growth moderates.

## Key Market Risks

Despite strong positioning, Adyen faces structural risks:
- increased competition from integrated PSPs,
- regulatory pressure on interchange and pricing,
- normalization of e-commerce growth post-pandemic.

These risks support a conservative DCF base case and explain the sensitivity of valuation to long-term assumptions.

## Market Research Implications for Valuation

Market dynamics justify Adyen’s premium relative to traditional payment processors.

However, sustaining the current market valuation requires:
- long-term growth above market averages,
- continued margin leadership,
- limited competitive erosion.

This explains the divergence between intrinsic value under conservative assumptions and current market pricing, as observed in the reverse DCF analysis.
