# 💡 Investment Thesis — Adyen N.V.

**TL;DR:**  
A conservative DCF valuation of Adyen implies an intrinsic value of ~€750 per share, materially below the current market price of ~€1,500+. A reverse DCF indicates that the market is implicitly pricing in long-term terminal growth of ~6%, well above long-term nominal GDP and the base-case assumption of 2.5%. Peer multiples confirm that Adyen trades at a significant premium to global payment peers, reflecting superior margins, growth durability, and perceived infrastructure-quality cash flows. While the business remains best-in-class, current valuation leaves limited margin of safety for valuation-driven investors.

- **Unified Commerce +31% YoY**, driven by retail, hospitality, and global POS expansion.

# 2. Superior Profitability and Clear Margin Expansion Path

Adyen demonstrates industry-leading profitability:

- **EBITDA margin reached 50% in H1 2025**, up from 46% a year earlier.  
- Management guides margins to **exceed 50% by 2026**, driven by operating leverage.  
- Strong free cash flow: **€474.5M FCF (+32% YoY)** with 87% conversion.  

This supports significant reinvestment capacity and provides resilience across cycles.

# 3. Structural Competitive Advantages Through Unified Infrastructure

Adyen’s moat is based on its **single global platform**, offering:

- Superior authorization rates and payment routing.  
- Full ownership of acquiring, issuing, risk, tokenization, and settlement.

# 4. High-Growth Opportunity in Embedded Finance (Platforms Segment)

Adyen is positioned to capitalize on one of the largest secular trends in fintech:

- Platform clients processing > €1B annually grew from **22 → 32 YoY**.
