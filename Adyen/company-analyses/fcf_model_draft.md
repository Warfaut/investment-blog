# Adyen — Free Cash Flow Model (Draft)

This document converts Adyen’s operating forecast into Free Cash Flow
through an EBIT-to-FCF bridge. It builds upon the base-case operating
assumptions established in Phase 2.

The model focuses on:
- Depreciation & amortisation
- Capital expenditures
- Working capital dynamics
- Cash taxes
- Resulting Free Cash Flow

## 1. EBITDA to EBIT Bridge

Depreciation & amortisation (D&A) is assumed at a flat 5% of revenue,
reflecting Adyen’s asset-light business model and historical capital intensity.

### Depreciation & Amortisation Assumptions

| Year | Revenue | D&A (% of Revenue) | D&A |
|------|---------|--------------------|-----|
| 2025E | 2,187 | 5% | 109 |
| 2026E | 2,521 | 5% | 126 |
| 2027E | 2,848 | 5% | 142 |
| 2028E | 3,158 | 5% | 158 |

### EBIT Calculation

| Year | EBITDA | D&A | EBIT |
|------|--------|-----|------|
| 2025E | 1,094 | 109 | 985 |
| 2026E | 1,286 | 126 | 1,160 |
| 2027E | 1,481 | 142 | 1,339 |
| 2028E | 1,673 | 158 | 1,515 |

## 2. Capital Expenditures (CapEx)

Capital expenditures are assumed at 6% of revenue, reflecting ongoing
investments in Adyen’s platform infrastructure and Unified Commerce
terminal deployment.

### CapEx Assumptions

| Year | Revenue | CapEx (% of Revenue) | CapEx |
|------|---------|----------------------|-------|
| 2025E | 2,187 | 6% | 131 |
| 2026E | 2,521 | 6% | 151 |
| 2027E | 2,848 | 6% | 171 |
| 2028E | 3,158 | 6% | 189 |
